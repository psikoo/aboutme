  <strong>- Introduction:</strong>
  <br>
  A Digispark is an 
  <a href="https://content.instructables.com/F98/D011/JSCG6QG3/F98D011JSCG6QG3.pdf" target="_blank">Attiny85</a>
  microcontroller based development board, initially developed and distributed by Digistump LLC. 
  Digistump abandoned the project a couple of years ago and left the task of maintaining the drivers 
  and libraries to the Arduino community.
  <br>
  I came to know of this little and cute USBs <a href="#[1]">[^1]</a> after a friend of my mine 
  showed me one he had been playing around with. I fell in love instantly, and so I bought a
  couple of them through Amazon to experiment with them (they were really affordable, about 2â‚¬ each).
  <br>
  This blog is going to be recompilation of the steps I took in order to learn how to use these boards, 
  this will be useful for myself as reference if I ever decide to go back and tinker with one of these 
  boards or if anyone is interested in doing something similar to what I did.

  <strong>- Setup:</strong>
  <br>
  Setting up a development environment for the Digispark was a more involved process than it could
  initially seem. I decided to program the chip through its usb interface, as i don't have access to
  a chip programer or an arduino board. To do this we will need the 
  <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software" target="_blank">Arduino IDE</a>.
  <br>
  Once we have the IDE we need to download a plugin to support Attiny85 boards as they are not arduino
  and thus not supported by default. To do this go into: 
  <code>File > Preferences... > Additional boards manager URLs</code>
  We need to add the following URL into the box:
  <br>
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digistump/arduino-boards-index/master/package_digistump_index.json" target="_blank" class="medium">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digistump/arduino-boards-index/master/package_digistump_index.json</a>
  <br>
  The URL contains a definition of all the digistump boards with different build instructions and libraries.
  <br>
  We now need to install the "<mark>Digistump AVR Boards</mark>" board manager: 
  <code>Tools > Board > Boards manager...</code>
  During the installation process you will see one of the drivers fail to install, this is due to digistump
  abandoning the project. To fix this we need to manually install the drivers from 
  <a href="https://github.com/digistump/DigistumpArduino/releases/download/1.6.7/Digistump.Drivers.zip" target="_blank">Digistump's github</a>,
  all we need to do is uncompress the .zip and run "<mark>Install Drivers.exe</mark>".
  <br>
  Lastly, go into the "Select Board" and choose "Select other board and port...", in this menu select 
  "<mark>Digispark (Default - 16.5mhz)</mark>".
  <br>
  And thats it, you can now go and make programs for your Digispark

  <strong>- Hello World:</strong>
  <br>
  Now that our development environment is working correctly we can try and upload a small Hello World
  program to our Digispark, the Hello World version of embedded systems is a blinking led. According
  to the 
  <a href="https://content.instructables.com/F98/D011/JSCG6QG3/F98D011JSCG6QG3.pdf" target="_blank">Attiny reference</a>
  for our middle the pin corresponding to the red led is pin number 1. 
  <br>
  So we just need to write a program that sets pin 1 high and low repeatedly:
</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">
void setup() {
  pinMode(1, OUTPUT);
}
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(1, HIGH);   
  delay(500);                      
  digitalWrite(1, LOW);    
  delay(500);              
}
</code></pre>
